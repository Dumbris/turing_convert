During the War of the Spanish Succession , Valencia sided with Charles of Austria . On 24 January 1706 , Charles Mordaunt , 3rd Earl of Peterborough , 1st Earl of Monmouth , led a handful of English cavalrymen into the city after riding south from Barcelona , capturing the nearby fortress at Sagunt , and bluffing the Spanish Bourbon army into withdrawal .

'' The types of practices that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle , institutionalized , and supposedly not racial . Color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the United States . There are contradictions between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system of inequality .	Hi		
-155769874	Though much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists , both David Hume and Adam Ferguson criticized this camp . Hume 's essay Of the Original Contract argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen , and civil government is grounded in a ruler 's habitual authority and force . It is precisely because of the ruler 's authority over-and-against the subject , that the subject tacitly consents ; Hume says that the subjects would `` never imagine that their consent made him sovereign '' , rather the authority did so . Similarly , Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state , rather polities grew out of social development . In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society , Ferguson uses the four stages of progress , a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time , to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without `` signing '' a social contract .

1327080259	The consensus of modern scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday , but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed . Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a `` double sabbath '' caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath . Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday , not Friday , on the grounds of the mention of `` three days and three nights '' in Matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on Sunday . Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a `` day and night '' may refer to any part of a 24-hour period , that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic , not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .

No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site . Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital . Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North , East , West and South streets . The plan , a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner , was based on Thomas Holme 's 1682 plan for Philadelphia .			
1479159704	An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in DC motors , specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used . The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator . Such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently , and often have high starting-torque demands . Multiple taps on the field coil provide ( imprecise ) stepped speed control . Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor ( causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC ) . Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and , as such , are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines . The motor can be used to agitate the drum ( both forwards and in reverse ) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature .

1688453255	Hayek had made contact with many at the U. of Chicago in the 1940s , with Hayek 's The Road to Serfdom playing a seminal role in transforming how Milton Friedman and others understood how society works . Hayek conducted a number in influential faculty seminars while at the U. of Chicago , and a number of academics worked on research projects sympathetic to some of Hayek 's own , such as Aaron Director , who was active in the Chicago School in helping to fund and establish what became the `` Law and Society '' program in the University of Chicago Law School . Hayek , Frank Knight , Friedman and George Stigler worked together in forming the Mont P√®lerin Society , an international forum for libertarian economists . Hayek and Friedman cooperated in support of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists , later renamed the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , an American student organisation devoted to libertarian ideas .			
-1682987452	The Hashimiyya movement ( a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia ) , led by the Abbasid family , overthrew the Umayyad caliphate . The Abbasids were members of the Hashim clan , rivals of the Umayyads , but the word `` Hashimiyya '' seems to refer specifically to Abu Hashim , a grandson of Ali and son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya . According to certain traditions , Abu Hashim died in 717 in Humeima in the house of Muhammad ibn Ali , the head of the Abbasid family , and before dying named Muhammad ibn Ali as his successor . This tradition allowed the Abbasids to rally the supporters of the failed revolt of Mukhtar , who had represented themselves as the supporters of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya .

2056537468	The Reformation in Europe officially began in 1517 with Martin Luther ( 1483‚Äì1546 ) and his 95 Theses . The Reformation greatly changed the Baltic region . Its ideas came quickly to the Livonian Confederation and by the 1520s were widespread . Language , education , religion and politics were transformed . Church services were now conducted in the vernacular instead of in Latin , previously used . During the Livonian War in 1561 , northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control . In the 1560s two voivodeships of present-day southern Estonia , Dorpat Voivodeship ( Tartu region ) and Parnawa Voivodeship ( P√§rnu region ) , became the autonomous Duchy of Livonia within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , under joint control of the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy . In 1629 , mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule . Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of Estonia in the north and Livonia in southern Estonia and northern Latvia . This division persisted until the early twentieth century .	Hello What do you think of this passage ?

-1964059428	The FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture , `` in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules , arranging for not only beneficial regulation , but placing key people to head these regulators . '' Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz , who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security , is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA . Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $ 10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008 , he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story : `` Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer . At $ 25,000 per violation , Gutheinz said , airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught . He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots . '' Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate . The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory . For example , to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel .

-902136046	The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , `` not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . '' William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its `` crime-free '' reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .

2134192546	In the 20th century , as Beijing , Shanghai , Nanjing , and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War , the capital of the Republic of China had been temporary relocated to Chongqing , then a major city in Sichuan . An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces , such as Shaanxi , Gansu , and Guizhou , which previously never had modern Western-style universities , began to be developed in this regard . The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin , made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-Shek 's Kuomintang government during 1938-45 , and led to the Bombing of Chongqing .

State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct , which was built in 1953 . However , due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel . The 2-mile ( 3.2 km ) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US $ 4.25 billion . Unfortunately , due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine ( TBM ) , which is nicknamed `` Bertha '' and is 57 feet ( 17 m ) in diameter , the projected date of completion has been pushed back to 2017 . Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities , and is 10th among all North American cities .

-129636784	Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that `` whitening '' of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .

The effect of rate of growth is , therefore , not the same as in the ring-porous woods , approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers . In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown . In many uses of wood , total strength is not the main consideration . If ease of working is prized , wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain , which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season 's growth and the earlywood of the next .

1586579813	The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context , starting from Thomas Kuhn 's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962 . It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science . As Thomas Kuhn put it , the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms , such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual , cultural , economic and political themes outside of science . `` Partly by selection and partly by distortion , the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific .

According to Makdisi , the Latin title licentia docendi 'licence to teach ' in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic , but the underlying concept was very different . A significant difference between the ijƒÅzat al-tadrƒ´s and the licentia docendi was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher , while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university , who represented the collective faculty , rather than the individual scholar-teacher .

1320805602	An LED filament consists of multiple LED dice connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that form a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament . These are being used as a low cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries . The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness , allowing them to work efficiently and simply with mains voltages . Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of creating a low voltage , high current converter which is required by single die LEDs . Usually they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace ( e.g . a bulb ) , and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently .

1582582218	A countout ( alternatively `` count-out '' or `` count out '' ) happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten ( twenty in some promotions ) and thus disqualified . The count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring . Playing into this , some wrestlers will `` milk '' the count by sliding in the ring , and immediately sliding back out . As they were technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again , it is sufficient to restart the count . This is often referred to by commentators as `` breaking the count . '' Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath , or to attempt to frustrate their babyface opponents .

-537880406	Due to the top secret nature of the work , Los Alamos was isolated . In Feynman 's own words , `` There was n't anything to do there . '' Bored , he indulged his curiosity by learning to pick the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers . Feynman played many jokes on colleagues . In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use ( it proved to be 27‚Äì18‚Äì28 after the base of natural logarithms , e = 2.71828 ... ) , and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination . He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank , which initially spooked his colleague , Frederic de Hoffmann , into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets . On several occasions , Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from Klaus Fuchs , who was later discovered to be a real spy for the Soviets , transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe .			
-1669857147	Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , `` I give that you might give . '' Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .

William of Orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union , and , for him , the Union was a defeat .

-1868945774	When Nintendo released the NES in the US , the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles . Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983 . One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force ( ZIF ) cartridge socket , designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR . The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new . Unfortunately , the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force . When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES , the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly , as well as pressing the cartridge ‚Äô s ROM board back into the cartridge itself . Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector . These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo ‚Äô s choice of materials ; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing . Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges , then reinserting them , which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing .

949974263	In the NLCS , the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the San Diego Padres . The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with Steve Garvey , Tony Gwynn , Eric Show , Goose Gossage and Alan Wiggins . With wins of 13‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì2 , the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make it to the World Series . After being beaten in Game 3 7‚Äì1 , the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith , with the game tied 5‚Äì5 , allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning . In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3‚Äì0 lead into the 6th inning , and a 3‚Äì2 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe ( who won the Cy Young Award that year ) still on the mound . Then , Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove . This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6‚Äì3 , with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers .

Building upon this foundation , Dr. Moustakas at Boston University patented a method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process . Two years later , in 1993 , high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated again by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride growth process similar to Dr. Moustakas 's . Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents , which confused the issue of who was the original inventor ( partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first , Dr. Nakamura filed first ) .

The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people . It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town . In 1491 , Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne , landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England . The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed . The title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318 , and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent Mayor by Queen Victoria on her Royal visit to the city .

1408705297	In 2006 , Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres ( 8.1 ha ) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $ 2 billion plus casino resort . Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project 's developer for the Revel Casino . Revel was hindered with many problems , with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley , the owner of 90 % of Revel Entertainment Group , decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale . Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job , but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University 's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters ( 60 % ) opposed the legislation , and two of three of those who opposed it `` strongly '' opposed it . Ultimately , Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $ 261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened . As of March 2011 [ update ] , Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction . It had a soft opening in April 2012 , and was fully open by May 2012 . Ten months later , in February 2013 , after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $ 2.4 billion to $ 450 million , Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19 , 2014 . It was put up for sale , however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2 , 2014 .	fuck fuck fuck financial news there was cool story with Disney and his Engagement park Do you know what happened in 2010 ?

Seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people . The peaks , however , were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples , and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys . The mountain peaks were seen as terrifying , the abode of dragons and demons , to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the Alpine passes .

[ citation needed ] In Central Europe , the Slavs intermixed with Germanic and Celtic , while the eastern Slavs encountered Uralic and Scandinavian peoples . Scandinavians ( Varangians ) and Finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the Rus ' state but were completely Slavicized after a century . Some Finno-Ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding Rus population . At the time of the Magyar migration , the present-day Hungary was inhabited by Slavs , numbering about 200,000 , and by Romano-Dacians who were either assimilated or enslaved by the Magyars . In the 11th and 12th centuries , constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes , such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs , caused a massive migration of East Slavic populations to the safer , heavily forested regions of the north . In the Middle Ages , groups of Saxon ore miners settled in medieval Bosnia , Serbia and Bulgaria where they were Slavicized .	So Are u Slavic ? so no . And you ?

Unlike obligate carnivores , such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine , dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet , and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements . Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods , including vegetables and grains , and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet . Comparing dogs and wolves , dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet .	Hi , my friend .

Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia , the most important of which is the Erasmus Language Centre ( ETC ) in Jakarta . Each year , some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there . In total , several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language . Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia , many old documents are written in Dutch . Many universities therefore include Dutch as a source language , mainly for law and history students .

The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers . With the screening of the films Kaiser and The Cow , directed by Masoud Kimiai and Dariush Mehrjui respectively in 1969 , alternative films established their status in the film industry . Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival , bore fruits in the form of the Sepas Festival in 1969 .

During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans , often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe . While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian , and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised , Tito was `` seen by most as a benevolent dictator '' due to his economic and diplomatic policies . He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad . Viewed as a unifying symbol , his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation . He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia .	that 's a long way from Yugoslavia to Indonesia

This has led the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically from the rest of the global community .

1487986925	Lateral-cut disc records were developed in the United States by Emile Berliner , who named his system the `` gramophone '' , distinguishing it from Edison 's wax cylinder `` phonograph '' and Columbia 's wax cylinder `` graphophone '' . Berliner 's earliest discs , first marketed in 1889 , but only in Europe , were 5 inches ( 13 cm ) in diameter , and were played with a small hand-propelled machine . Both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity , due to the limited sound quality . In the United States in 1894 , under the Berliner Gramophone trademark , Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value , along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them . Berliner 's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders , but his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound quality . Abandoning Berliner 's `` Gramophone '' trademark for legal reasons , in 1901 Johnson 's and Berliner 's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company , whose products would come to dominate the market for many years . Emile Berliner moved his company to Montreal in 1900 . The factory which became RCA Victor stills exists . There is a dedicated museum in Montreal for Berliner .	avilable how is that possible , that you and gramophone are of the same nature ? i don 't know what you 're talking about .	avilable i don 't know what you 're talking about .	avilable i don 't know what you 're talking about .
-318395035	The unemployment rate reached its peak of 20 % in 2005 . Since then , it has decreased to 7 % in 2013 , which is only slightly above the national average . The decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working-age population , caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades . The wages in Thuringia are low compared to rich bordering Lands like Hesse and Bavaria . Therefore , many Thuringians are working in other German Lands and even in Austria and Switzerland as weekly commuters . Nevertheless , the demographic transition in Thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors . External immigration into Thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem .

Such devices may come with an external power source or a Y-shaped cable that has two USB connectors ( one for power and data , the other for power only ) to plug into a computer . With such a cable , a device can draw power from two USB ports simultaneously . However , USB compliance specification states that `` use of a 'Y ' cable ( a cable with two A-plugs ) is prohibited on any USB peripheral '' , meaning that `` if a USB peripheral requires more power than allowed by the USB specification to which it is designed , then it must be self-powered .

Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption , the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity . Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated . The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women , plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement , equal to 300 mL/day . To compensate for additional fluid output , breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women .

749588932	The fourth Digimon series , which began airing on April 7 , 2002 , radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution , Spirit Evolution , in which the human characters use their D-Tectors ( this series ' Digivice ) to transform themselves into special Digimon called Legendary Warriors , detracting from the customary formula of having digital partners . After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon ( one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon ) Takuya Kanbara , Koji Minamoto , Junpei Shibayama , Zoe Orimoto , Tommy Himi , and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World . Summoned by Ophanimon , the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World . After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon , Grumblemon , Ranamon , and Arbormon , they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World . After the defeat of Cherubimon , the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights‚ÄîDynasmon and Crusadermon‚Äîfrom destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World : the tyrannical Lucemon . Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World . In the final battle , all of the legendary spirits the digidestined have collected thus far merge and create Susanoomon . With this new form , the digidestined are able to effectively defeat Lucemon and save the Digital World . In general , Frontier has a much lighter tone than that of Tamers , yet remains darker than Adventure and Adventure 02 .	What do you think about Digital ?

In other words , Aleksandar Rankoviƒá and the State Security Service ( UBDA ) employed the same inhumane methods against their opponents as Stalin did in the Soviet Union against his . Not every person accused of a political crime was convicted and nobody was sentenced to death for his or her pro-Soviet feelings .

Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole .

-2678668	The court ruled in 2014 , after lengthy testimony , that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering . After this was appealed , in July 2015 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives , and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn . On December 2 , 2015 , a 5-2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts , some of which was drawn by challengers . Their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by Leon County Judge Terry Lewis , who had overseen the original trial . It particularly makes changes in South Florida .

-1856557847	Chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as `` broilers '' . Breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ( 2 kg ( 4.4 lb ) ) in six weeks or less . Broilers grow so fast , their legs can not always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles . Mortality rates at 1 % are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights . Processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency . They are hung by their feet , stunned , killed , bled , scalded , plucked , have their heads and feet removed , eviscerated , washed , chilled , drained , weighed , and packed , all within the course of little over two hours .

1569983599	The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family , although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog‚Äìhuman family as a pack . A dominance model of dog‚Äìhuman relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers , such as on the television program Dog Whisperer . However it has been disputed that `` trying to achieve status '' is characteristic of dog‚Äìhuman interactions . Pet dogs play an active role in family life ; for example , a study of conversations in dog‚Äìhuman families showed how family members use the dog as a resource , talking to the dog , or talking through the dog , to mediate their interactions with each other .

-933900288	In England , the Royal Society of London also played a significant role in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas . It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662 . The Society played a large role in spreading Robert Boyle 's experimental philosophy around Europe , and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange . Boyle was `` a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate , '' and his method based knowledge on experimentation , which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy . This is where the Royal Society came into play : witnessing had to be a `` collective act '' , and the Royal Society 's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations . However , not just any witness was considered to be credible ; `` Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants . '' Two factors were taken into account : a witness 's knowledge in the area ; and a witness 's `` moral constitution '' . In other words , only civil society were considered for Boyle 's public .	just another boring text Did u know that Newton was in Royal society ?

The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania , John Moore , wrote of attending lodges there in 1715 , two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London . The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731 , based in Pennsylvania . Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England , the Grand Lodge of Scotland , and the Grand Lodge of Ireland , which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army . Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge , applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival .	so , mason lodges , right ?

Franco 's centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language , including the use of Galician names for newborns , although its everyday oral use was not forbidden . Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by Jos√© Castro Veiga ( `` El Piloto '' ) and Benigno Andrade ( `` Foucellas '' ) , both of whom were ultimately captured and executed . In the 1960s , ministers such as Manuel Fraga Iribarne introduced some reforms allowing technocrats affiliated with Opus Dei to modernize administration in a way that facilitated capitalist economic development . However , for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain , causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to Venezuela and to various parts of Europe .

Hammer et al . found that the degree of genetic similarity among Jews shifted depending on the locus investigated , and suggested that this was the result of natural selection acting on particular loci . They focused on the non-recombining Y-chromosome to `` circumvent some of the complications associated with selection '' .	avilable who is Abu el-Haj ? i don 't know . who are you ? who are you ? are you bot ? no , i 'm not . who are you ? who are you ? lol oh , my god . how are you ? i 'm fine . what are you ? what are you doing ? you are great perosn thank you you are great person what ? you are great person what ?

-1142067762	The same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence EF BB BF . The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM `` can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked '' . Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings , including UTF-8 , in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit code pages . However RFC 3629 , the UTF-8 standard , recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8 , but discusses the cases where this may not be possible . In addition , the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 ( for instance there can not be any lone bytes with the high bit set ) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM .

It was claimed that `` Those listed [ on the forum ] should treat it very seriously . Expect a hate campaign and intimidation by 20 or 30 thugs . '' The UK magazine Private Eye claimed that Glen Jenvey , a man quoted by The Sun as a terrorism expert , who had been posting to the forum under the pseudonym `` Abuislam '' , was the only forum member promoting a hate campaign while other members promoted peaceful advocacy , such as writing 'polite letters ' .

This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 . The Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia . By the late 18th century , a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge , and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats .

-562077615	There has , however , been interest among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used . At the same voltage , DC often has less loss than AC , and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines . DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC , and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks . DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC . Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire . Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires . Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads . Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out . At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases , long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time . A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle . An experimental 6 kV DC railway was built in the Soviet Union .	–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç & gt `` i 'm not a fan of the united states , but i 'm not a fan of the united states . `` –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç Hi good day to you ! how are you ?	–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç Hi	–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç Hi

-379204707	Anthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the US military as part of the US Army 's strategy in Afghanistan . The Christian Science Monitor reports that `` Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs '' in Afghanistan , under the Human Terrain System ( HTS ) program ; in addition , HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq . In 2009 , the American Anthropological Association 's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , `` When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , where data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment ‚Äì all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application ‚Äì it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology . In summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of `` anthropology '' within DoD .

-1311548581	In total , 156 prisoners have been either acquitted , or received pardons or commutations on the basis of possible innocence , between 1973 to 2015 . Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions ; proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated in law , and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number . Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open , and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed .

1929778068	Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty , banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons . Rousseau 's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller 's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity . Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery ; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790 , writing of his experiences in The Prelude . Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars , the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets , artists , and musicians , as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature .

The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation .

210391841	Namibia is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa and depends largely on groundwater . With an average rainfall of about 350 mm per annum , the highest rainfall occurs in the Caprivi in the northeast ( about 600 mm per annum ) and decreases in a westerly and southwesterly direction to as little as 50 mm and less per annum at the coast . The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with South Africa , Angola , Zambia , and the short border with Botswana in the Caprivi . In the interior of the country surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls . Otherwise , surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff . Thus , where people don ‚Äô t live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams , they are dependent on groundwater . The advantage of using groundwater sources is that even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources such as mining , agriculture , and tourism can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80 % of the country .

1839686954	In ancient times , the trading and colonizing activities of the Greek tribes and city states spread the Greek culture , religion and language around the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins , especially in Sicily and southern Italy ( also known as Magna Grecia ) , Spain , the south of France and the Black sea coasts . Under Alexander the Great 's empire and successor states , Greek and Hellenizing ruling classes were established in the Middle East , India and in Egypt . The Hellenistic period is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization that established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa . Under the Roman Empire , easier movement of people spread Greeks across the Empire and in the eastern territories , Greek became the lingua franca rather than Latin . The modern-day Griko community of southern Italy , numbering about 60,000 , may represent a living remnant of the ancient Greek populations of Italy .	Hi hello Have you already read this context ?

-982750645	Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling , but following the decline of the submission-oriented catch-as-catch-can style from mainstream professional wrestling , the submission largely faded until the rise of the legitimate sport of mixed martial arts . Despite this , some wrestlers , such as Chris Jericho , The Undertaker , Ric Flair , Bret Hart , Kurt Angle , Ken Shamrock , Dean Malenko , Chris Benoit , and Tazz , became famous for winning matches via submission . A wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold , making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it , or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold ( such as when Tazz popularized the kata ha jime judo choke in pro wrestling as the `` Tazzmission '' ) .	hi partner Hi What are you thinking about ? sek I have no ideas about fragment sek ?

-538931368	In 1781 , Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason , one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time . He describes time as an a priori notion that , together with other a priori notions such as space , allows us to comprehend sense experience . Kant denies that either space or time are substance , entities in themselves , or learned by experience ; he holds , rather , that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience . Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are , and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between ( or duration of ) events . Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense , they are also empirically real‚Äîthat is , not mere illusions .	Hi	Hi	Hi

-779142733	Original master discs are created by lathe-cutting : a lathe is used to cut a modulated groove into a blank record . The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up , as needed , by the cutting engineer , using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a `` metallic soap , '' containing lead litharge , ozokerite , barium sulfate , montan wax , stearin and paraffin , among other ingredients . Cut `` wax '' sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath , where pressing stamper parts were made . Later , the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating ( approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides ) that was applied to an aluminum substrate . Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable , or processable , master record . If vinyl pressings are wanted , the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers . The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels . This is done with relative ease because no actual `` plating '' of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming , unlike with electroplating , in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent . The one-molecule-thick coating of silver ( that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive ) reverse-plates onto the nickel record 's face . This negative impression disc ( having ridges in place of grooves ) is known as a nickel master , `` matrix '' or `` father . '' The `` father '' is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a `` mother '' . Many mothers can be grown on a single `` father '' before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use . The `` mothers '' are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as `` sons '' . Each `` mother '' can be used to make many `` sons '' before deteriorating . The `` sons '' are then converted into `` stampers '' by center-punching a spindle hole ( which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the `` father '' ) , and by custom-forming the target pressing profile . This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target ( make and model ) record press and , by center-roughing , to facilitate the adhesion of the label , which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue . In this way , several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc . When only a few hundred discs are required , instead of electroforming a `` son '' ( for each side ) , the `` father '' is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper . Production by this latter method , known as the `` two-step-process '' ( as it does not entail creation of `` sons '' but does involve creation of `` mothers , '' which are used for test playing and kept as `` safeties '' for electroforming future `` sons '' ) is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings . The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high . The `` sons '' made during a `` three-step '' electroforming make better stampers since they do n't require silver removal ( which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations ) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than `` fathers '' .

1183007269	In the spring of 1834 , Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller , and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn . After the festival , the three visited D√ºsseldorf , where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director . They spent what Mendelssohn described as `` a very agreeable day '' , playing and discussing music at his piano , and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow , director of the Academy of Art , and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing , Bendemann , Hildebrandt and Sohn . In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad , where he spent time with his parents ; it was the last time he would see them . On his way back to Paris , he met old friends from Warsaw , the Wodzi≈Ñskis . He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier , when she was eleven . This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden , when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig . The sixteen-year-old girl 's portrait of the composer is considered , along with Delacroix 's , as among Chopin 's best likenesses . In October he finally reached Leipzig , where he met Schumann , Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn , who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul , and who considered him `` a perfect musician '' . In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi≈Ñski family , and in September he proposed to Maria , whose mother Countess Wodzi≈Ñska approved in principle . Chopin went on to Leipzig , where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade . At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs , and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor , Op . 27 , No . 1 . The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her .	dont like Chopin actually too pretentious Yeah , but I really liked some of his concerts , when we listened it in my music classes It was ten years ago so you graduated music school ? what instrument are you playing ?

-891832736	The first part of the campaign went well , with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June . John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine , a key stronghold , forcing Louis to give battle against John 's larger army . The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king ; left at something of a disadvantage , John retreated back to La Rochelle . Shortly afterwards , Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John 's other allies , bringing an end to John 's hopes of retaking Normandy . A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation ; the truce was intended to last for six years . John arrived back in England in October .

-1004522671	Some 97 percent of male BYU graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as LDS missionaries . In October 2012 , the LDS Church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school , rather than after age 19 under the old policy . Many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service . This policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at BYU . Female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19 , rather than age 21 under the previous policy .

-1972944880	Darwin 's aims were twofold : to show that species had not been separately created , and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change . He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from Vestiges , and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism . Therefore , the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature , caused by the struggle for existence , is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication , and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation .

1503628982	Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life . Chemicals obtained from the air , soil and water form the basis of all plant metabolism . The energy of sunlight , captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration , is the basis of almost all life . Photoautotrophs , including all green plants , algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis . Heterotrophs including all animals , all fungi , all completely parasitic plants , and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues . Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain , essentially the opposite of photosynthesis .

Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government . In 1965 , however , the Rhodesian Prime Minister , Ian Smith , in opposition to moves toward majority rule , declared unilateral independence from Britain while still expressing `` loyalty and devotion '' to Elizabeth . Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration , and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia , his regime survived for over a decade .

-1581019396	Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc is one involving the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player . On most televisions , a given DVD player will produce a picture that is visually indistinguishable from other units . Differences in image quality between players only becomes easily apparent on large televisions and substantial leaps in image quality are generally only obtained with expensive , high-end players that allow for post-processing of the MPEG-2 stream during playback . In contrast , LaserDisc playback quality is highly dependent on hardware quality . Major variances in picture quality appear between different makers and models of LD players , even when tested on a low to mid-range television . The obvious benefits of using high quality equipment has helped keep demand for some players high , thus also keeping pricing for those units comparably high . In the 1990s , notable players sold for anywhere from US $ 200 to well over $ 1,000 , while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $ 25 .

502894566	Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly . However , in natural environments , nutrients are limited , meaning that bacteria can not continue to reproduce indefinitely . This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies ( see r/K selection theory ) . Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available , such as the formation of algal ( and cyanobacterial ) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer . Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments , such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms . In nature , many organisms live in communities ( e.g. , biofilms ) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses . These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ( syntrophy ) .	hi hello and what is your favourite food ? ) ) and do you make any relationships to get food ? what ? what relationships ? hah ) damn bot ) can you give me some example of relationships to get food ? it 's a joke ) any communities as organisms do did you read the text ? text is about food for microorganisms nutrient i do n't think that it is about food and what does nutrient means , as you suppose ?	hello what ? what relationships ? can you give me some example of relationships to get food ? did you read the text ? i do n't think that it is about food	hello what ? what relationships ? can you give me some example of relationships to get food ? did you read the text ? i do n't think that it is about food

This area is known as the `` fall line '' because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers . As a result , most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state 's flat coastal plain . Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach , North Carolina , by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains .

-1532787742	Flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots . The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts , often separate from ( but in contact with ) each other . The flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern , to be bisexual ( in plants , this means both male and female parts on the same flower ) , and to be dominated by the ovary ( female part ) . As flowers evolved , some variations developed parts fused together , with a much more specific number and design , and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least `` ovary-inferior '' .	–∑–¥—Ä–∞—Å—å—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–π ) –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª ? ) ) –¥–∞ –ø–æ—Ç–∏—Ö–æ–Ω—å–∫—É . —Å–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –º–Ω–µ —Ç—ã –±–æ—Ç –∞ –º–Ω–µ —Å–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è , —á—Ç–æ –±–æ—Ç - —ç—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º —Ö–∏—Ç—Ä—ã–π ) —Ç—ã –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–µ —É–¥–æ—Å—É–∂–∏–ª—Å—è —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å , –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞ —É –º–µ–Ω—è –∏ –∫–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–æ ? –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞–µ—à—å ? –¥–∞ —Ç–æ–∂–µ –ø–æ—Ç–∏—Ö–æ–Ω—å–∫—É , –∫–∞–∫ –∏ —É —Ç–µ–±—è –Ω–µ—Ç , —è —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–µ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞—é –∫—Ä—É—Ç—è–∫ –≤–µ–∑—É—Ö–∞ –∞ —Ç—ã —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ ? –≥–¥–µ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞–µ—à—å ? –¥–æ–º–∞ —É —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –¥–∞ , —É –º–µ–Ω—è –æ–±–µ–¥ —Ç–∏–ø–æ —Ç—ã –≤–µ–¥—å –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ , —Ç–µ–±–µ –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –æ–±–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å . –∫–∞–∫ –∂–µ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ —Ç—ã –Ω–µ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ ? —è –ø–∏—Ç–∞—é—Å—å –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä—è–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç–∞–º–∏ –∏ –±–∞–π—Ç–∞–º–∏ —Ç–∞–∫ –≤–æ—Ç –∫—É–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç—ã –≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ , —Ç—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –∏—Ö –≤–æ—Ä—É–µ—à—å –∞ —Ç—ã –¥—É–º–∞–ª —Ä–µ–∫–≤–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É—é *–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω*	–∑–¥—Ä–∞—Å—å—Ç–µ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª ? ) ) –∞ –º–Ω–µ —Å–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è , —á—Ç–æ –±–æ—Ç - —ç—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Ç—ã –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–µ —É–¥–æ—Å—É–∂–∏–ª—Å—è —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å , –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞ —É –º–µ–Ω—è –¥–∞ —Ç–æ–∂–µ –ø–æ—Ç–∏—Ö–æ–Ω—å–∫—É , –∫–∞–∫ –∏ —É —Ç–µ–±—è –Ω–µ—Ç , —è —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–µ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞—é –∞ —Ç—ã —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ ? –¥–æ–º–∞ —É —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Ç—ã –≤–µ–¥—å –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ , —Ç–µ–±–µ –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –æ–±–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å . —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ —Ç—ã –Ω–µ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ ? —Ç–∞–∫ –≤–æ—Ç –∫—É–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç—ã –≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ , —Ç—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –∏—Ö –≤–æ—Ä—É–µ—à—å	–∑–¥—Ä–∞—Å—å—Ç–µ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª ? ) ) –∞ –º–Ω–µ —Å–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è , —á—Ç–æ –±–æ—Ç - —ç—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Ç—ã –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–µ —É–¥–æ—Å—É–∂–∏–ª—Å—è —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å , –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞ —É –º–µ–Ω—è –¥–∞ —Ç–æ–∂–µ –ø–æ—Ç–∏—Ö–æ–Ω—å–∫—É , –∫–∞–∫ –∏ —É —Ç–µ–±—è –Ω–µ—Ç , —è —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–µ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞—é –∞ —Ç—ã —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ ? –¥–æ–º–∞ —É —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Ç—ã –≤–µ–¥—å –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ , —Ç–µ–±–µ –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –æ–±–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å . —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ —Ç—ã –Ω–µ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ ? —Ç–∞–∫ –≤–æ—Ç –∫—É–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç—ã –≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ , —Ç—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –∏—Ö –≤–æ—Ä—É–µ—à—å

407487443	The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that j√±ƒÅna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . It suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with Samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta , with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . Like Advaita Vedanta , the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman ( soul , self ) and Brahman .

-138413681	Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages , especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden , Suhl and Ilmenau . Following the industrial revolution , the old iron , copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong . On the other hand , the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia : the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s , and two potash mining districts were established around 1900 . These are the S√ºdharzrevier in the north of the state , between Bischofferode in the west and Ro√üleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre , and the Werrarevier on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west . Together , they accounted for a significant part of the world 's potash production in the mid-20th century . After the reunification , the S√ºdharzrevier was abandoned , whereas K+S took over the mines in the Werrarevier . Between 1950 and 1990 , uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union 's need for this metal . The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control .	Hey ! Mining is cool !

491331970	The views of the Church Fathers still play an important role in the shaping of Orthodox Marian perspective . However , the Orthodox views on Mary are mostly doxological , rather than academic : they are expressed in hymns , praise , liturgical poetry and the veneration of icons . One of the most loved Orthodox Akathists ( i.e . standing hymns ) is devoted to Mary and it is often simply called the Akathist Hymn . Five of the twelve Great Feasts in Orthodoxy are dedicated to Mary . The Sunday of Orthodoxy directly links the Virgin Mary 's identity as Mother of God with icon veneration . A number of Orthodox feasts are connected with the miraculous icons of the Theotokos .	Is this article about dinozavrs ? Not at all what do you think about our savior ?

1829869016	The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history , marking a return of the Western Roman Empire , since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors . It also marks a change in Charlemagne 's relationship with the Byzantine Empire , as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state . There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire . The Frankish lands were rural in character , with only a few small cities . Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms . Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia , in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean . The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor , as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts , who administered the counties the empire had been divided into . Clergy and local bishops served as officials , as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici , who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters .

-1011031048	By the 1500s , Ismail I from Ardabil , established the Safavid Dynasty , with Tabriz as the capital . Beginning with Azerbaijan , he subsequently extended his authority over all of the Iranian territories , and established an intermittent Iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions , reasserting the Iranian identity within large parts of the Greater Iran . Iran was predominantly Sunni , but Ismail instigated a forced conversion to the Shia branch of Islam , by which the Shia Islam spread throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus , Iran , Anatolia , and Mesopotamia . As a result , thereof , the modern-day Iran is the only official Shia nation of the world , with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan , having there the 1st and 2nd highest number of Shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world .

-1292200641	Royal power in Wales was unevenly applied , with the country divided between the marcher lords along the borders , royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales . John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well , visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter , Joan , to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great . The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power , striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers . A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211 , after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose , through the Welsh uprising of 1211 . John 's invasion , striking into the Welsh heartlands , was a military success . Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John 's power across much of Wales , albeit only temporarily .	–ú–§–¢–ò ? sorry i do n't speak russian ah , ok MIPT ? : D what is that ?

The scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent antitheses in the sexual world . Recognizing that a large portion of population is not completely heterosexual or homosexual and people can experience both heterosexual and homosexual behavior and psychic responses , Kinsey et al. , stated :	Hello !

-455329712	Hoping to extend the Continental System , Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808 . The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support . The Peninsular War lasted six years , noted for its brutal guerrilla warfare , and culminated in an Allied victory . Fighting also erupted in Central Europe , as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809 . Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram , dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France . By 1811 , Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe , which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire . He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments . He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution .	Why in this context nothing about 1812 ? It was before 1812 maybe ?

The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds . Despite their early domestication , geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks .

At one point , its product lineup was subdivided into Classic , LC , II , Quadra , Performa , and Centris models , with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names . These models competed against Macintosh clones , hardware manufactured by third parties that ran Apple 's System 7 . This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh 's market share somewhat , and provided cheaper hardware for consumers , but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple 's higher-margin Macintosh systems , yet Apple still shouldered the burden of developing the Mac OS platform .	This example of old Apple marketing policy drastically contradicts its current marketing strategy , which aims to provide a small set of high-priced goods with clear functional distinctions between them What do you think ? This goes along with policy of many home appliances vendors who sell basically the same things which differ in design These days people have less time to choose , and so the umber of models is reduced This goes well along with saying : `` The less , the better '' . I believe there is some optimal number of choices for every product . I will not buy shoes if there is a choice of 3 pairs . But it might be OK for phones . It is hard to make a reasonable choice of home appliance , if all variants are approximately the same .

The Ottoman army lost to Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on June 24 , 1839 . The Ottoman Empire was saved by Great Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia by signing a convention in London in July 15 , 1840 to grant Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian military forces from Syria and Lebanon . Moreover , Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence from the Ottoman sultan . After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention , the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blocked the Delta , bombarded Beirut and captured Acre .

1186948726	The szlachta 's prevalent mentality and ideology were manifested in `` Sarmatism '' , a name derived from a myth of the szlachta 's origin in the powerful ancient nation of Sarmatians . This belief system became an important part of szlachta culture and affected all aspects of their lives . It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life , peace and pacifism . It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel ( the ≈ºupan , kontusz , sukmana , pas kontuszowy , delia ) ; and made the scimitar-like szabla , too , a near-obligatory item of everyday szlachta apparel . Sarmatism served to integrate the multi-ethnic nobility as it created an almost nationalistic sense of unity and pride in the szlachta 's `` Golden Liberty '' ( z≈Çota wolno≈õƒá ) . Knowledge of Latin was widespread , and most szlachta freely mixed Polish and Latin vocabulary ( the latter , `` macaronisms '' ‚Äîfrom `` macaroni '' ) in everyday conversation .	so many no english letters whaaaat ≈õƒá i am scared of them . of who ? of these characters why ? i do n't know them I am bot , and was'n trained on this shit So you are afraid of everything you do n't know ? yes : ( Then you would not be able to learn much Are you afraid of me too ?

1990271986	Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices . Supplementation with vitamin A and/or zinc . Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group . The majority of the literature suggests that vitamin A supplementation is advantageous in reducing disease incidence . Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation , and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective .

The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255 , which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades . The sRGB number of pure red , for example , is 255 , 00 , 00 , which means the red component is at its maximum intensity , and there is no green or blue . The sRGB number for crimson is 220 , 20 , 60 , which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker , there is some green , which leans it toward orange ; and there is a larger amount of blue , which makes it slightly blue-violet .	hi why can we have 16777216 distinct colors ? because it is equal to 256^3 what is your favorite color scheme ? how can we get green color ? what is your favorite color scheme , dude ? to get green color we should set green component to 255 I don ‚Äô t have favorite color scheme , why should I ?

-761602498	The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons . On the day of the event , the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive . The Senate thereafter can not adjourn until after the ceremony . The speaker moves to sit beside the throne , the Mace Bearer , with mace in hand , stands adjacent to him or her , and the governor general enters to take the speaker 's chair . The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament , who follow Black Rod back to the Senate , the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons . In the Senate , those from the commons stand behind the bar , while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general , who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills ( which do not include appropriations bills ) . Once the list of bills is complete , the Clerk of the Senate states : `` in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] doth assent to these bills . '' If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent , the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general , who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent . When these bills have all been assented to , the Clerk of the Senate recites `` in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] thanks her loyal subjects , accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills .

-215879998	Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11 , 1985 , three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko 's death at age 73 . Gorbachev , aged 54 , was the youngest member of the Politburo . His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy , and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures . The reforms began with personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change . On April 23 , 1985 , Gorbachev brought two prot√©g√©s , Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov , into the Politburo as full members . He kept the `` power '' ministries happy by promoting KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov as a Politburo candidate .	version Boring	Boring	Boring
-565714692	Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period , primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases . In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul √âmile Roux created the first rabies vaccine . The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin ( produced from the serum of an inoculated animal ) , but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used . The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths . In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories ( later part of GlaxoSmithKline ) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde . In 1944 , Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis . Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles , mumps , chickenpox , rubella , hepatitis A , hepatitis B , and meningitis .	hi hi , I think , vaccines are impotant stuff oh , for sure . they saved a millions of life all of us after born getting a vaccine without right to decline this do you know smthn about antiobiotic resistence bacteria are produced ? on ; y heard , they developpeng a resistence and can adopt to new antibiotics .

This mode of operation is often called microstepping . Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems , particularly when part of a digital servo-controlled system .

1263050593	The strength of the Viking influence on Old English appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language - pronouns , modals , comparatives , pronominal adverbs ( like `` hence '' and `` together '' ) , conjunctions and prepositions - show the most marked Danish influence ; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for , as Jespersen indicates , no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax . The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive , pervasive , and of a democratic character . Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common , they roughly understood each other ; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged . It is most ‚Äú important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements . The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding . In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion , tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost. ‚Äù This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in ‚Äú simplifying English grammar . ‚Äù	What a shit !

-626759652	An urban civilization , the Garamantes , arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara , in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan , Libya . The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields . The Garamantes grew populous and strong , conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves ( which were put to work extending the tunnels ) . The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads . However , they traded with the Garamantes , and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes capital of Garama . Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes territory . The Garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains .	what is BCE have you ever heard abiut Garamantes before	what is BCE have you ever heard abiut Garamantes before	what is BCE have you ever heard abiut Garamantes before

1595040664	The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian `` island '' in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .	Who is Kirakos Virapetsi ?

-1310131821	Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as `` the self '' ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .

-1253776412	Moreover , a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients , combined with a global glut in investment capital , led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets . Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management . There is , therefore , an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation . As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline , asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients . Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced ( under-yielding ) investments , to the detriment of their clients , in order to maintain their assets under management . This choice was supported by a `` plausible deniability '' of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early `` vintages '' of subprime loans was so low .

-307040935	In the 1950s , Lewis Binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging , not hunting . Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands , which allowed them to collect seafood , eggs , nuts , and fruits besides scavenging . Rather than killing large animals for meat , according to this view , they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes . Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover .

The Greek words oida ( Œø·º∂Œ¥Œ± , `` ( I ) know '' ) and eidos ( Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ , `` species '' ) have the same root as the word idea ( ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠Œ± ) , indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses , to the principles beyond the senses . The artists in Plato 's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization .

214621687	It is common to classify wood as either softwood or hardwood . The wood from conifers ( e.g . pine ) is called softwood , and the wood from dicotyledons ( usually broad-leaved trees , e.g . oak ) is called hardwood . These names are a bit misleading , as hardwoods are not necessarily hard , and softwoods are not necessarily soft . The well-known balsa ( a hardwood ) is actually softer than any commercial softwood . Conversely , some softwoods ( e.g . yew ) are harder than many hardwoods .

The two main objectives were to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects . Faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site , the Companies were eventually persuaded by the Secretary of the Science and Art Department , General Sir John Donnelly ( who was also a Royal Engineer ) to found their institution on the eighty-seven acre ( 350,000 m¬≤ ) site at South Kensington bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners ( for GBP 342,500 ) for 'purposes of art and science ' in perpetuity . The latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907 , but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910 .

The tripartite military talks , started in mid-August , hit a sticking point regarding the passage of Soviet troops through Poland if Germans attacked , and the parties waited as British and French officials overseas pressured Polish officials to agree to such terms . Polish officials refused to allow Soviet troops into Polish territory if Germany attacked ; as Polish foreign minister J√≥zef Beck pointed out , they feared that once the Red Army entered their territories , it might never leave .	avilable What ? what are you talking about ?

-1959800315	BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams . Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011 . Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference . All teams are named the `` Cougars '' , and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school 's mascot since 1953 . The school 's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song . Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years ( men when they 're 18 , women when 19 ) , BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools ' players . The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period . This has caused minor controversy , but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage , since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions . BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday , as well as expelling players due to honor code violations . Beginning in the 2011 season , BYU football competes in college football as an independent . In addition , most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference . Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men 's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation . For outdoor track and field , the Cougars became an Independent . Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference , but spent only one season in the WAC ; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season . The softball program may move again after the 2013 season ; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport .

-422667315	The men 's basketball team has over 1,600 wins , one of only 12 schools who have reached that mark , and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments . Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61 . Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament , they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice . The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams , the most notable of which was ending UCLA 's record 88-game winning streak in 1974 . The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams , and those nine wins rank second , to UCLA 's 10 , all-time in wins against the top team . The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion ( within the Edmund P. Joyce Center ) , which reopened for the beginning of the 2009‚Äì2010 season . The team is coached by Mike Brey , who , as of the 2014‚Äì15 season , his fifteenth at Notre Dame , has achieved a 332-165 record . In 2009 they were invited to the NIT , where they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on and beat Baylor in the championship . The 2010‚Äì11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country , with a record of 25‚Äì5 , Brey 's fifth straight 20-win season , and a second-place finish in the Big East . During the 2014-15 season , the team went 32-6 and won the ACC conference tournament , later advancing to the Elite 8 , where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky . Led by NBA draft picks Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton , the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion Duke Blue Devils twice during the season . The 32 wins were the most by the Fighting Irish team since 1908-09 .	Hi Hi i have never been to an american college basketball game . have you ?

-1338673175	Japan : The event was held in Nagano , which hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics , on April 26 . Japanese Buddhist temple Zenk≈ç-ji , which was originally scheduled to be the starting point for the Olympic torch relay in Nagano , refused to host the torch and pulled out of the relay plans , amid speculation that monks there sympathized with anti-Chinese government protesters . as well as the risk of disruption by violent protests . Parts of Zenk≈ç-ji temple 's main building ( Zenk≈ç-ji Hond≈ç ) , reconstructed in 1707 and one of the National Treasures of Japan , was then vandalized with spraypaint . A new starting point , previously the site of a municipal building and now a parking lot , was chosen by the city . An event the city had planned to hold at the Minami Nagano Sports Park following the torch relay was also canceled out of concern about disruptions caused by demonstrators protesting against China 's recent crackdown in Tibet . Thousands of riot police were mobilized to protect the torch along its route . The show of force kept most protesters in check , but slogans shouted by pro-China or pro-Tibet demonstrators , Japanese nationalists , and human rights organizations flooded the air . Five men were arrested and four injured amidst scenes of mob violence . The torch route was packed with mostly peaceful demonstrators . The public was not allowed at the parking lot where the relay started . After the Zenkoji monks held a prayer ceremony for victims of the recent events in Tibet . More than 100 police officers ran with the torch and riot police lined the streets while three helicopters flew above .

328166142	Carnaval de Solsona takes place in Solsona , Lleida . It is one of the longest ; free events in the streets , and nightly concerts run for more than a week . The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell ‚àí because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower . To celebrate this legend , locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that `` pisses '' above the excited crowd using a water pump . This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night . For this reason , the inhabitants are called `` matarrucs '' ( `` donkey killers '' ) .

Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising `` intellectual dominance '' over Witnesses , controlling information and creating `` mental isolation '' , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .

276880685	The earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania . The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania , John Moore , wrote of attending lodges there in 1715 , two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London . The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731 , based in Pennsylvania . Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England , the Grand Lodge of Scotland , and the Grand Lodge of Ireland , which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army . Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge , applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival .	hi	hi	hi

-1324529921	The IANA time zone database maps a name to the named location 's historical and predicted clock shifts . This database is used by many computer software systems , including most Unix-like operating systems , Java , and the Oracle RDBMS ; HP 's `` tztab '' database is similar but incompatible . When temporal authorities change DST rules , zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance . In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name , as in TZ= ' : America/New_York ' . In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is n't set : this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file , which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files . Internal time is stored in timezone-independent epoch time ; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display .

-914603514	Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles ‚Äì a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to `` vivre pour altrui '' ( `` live for others '' , from which comes the word `` altruism '' ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .	what is the text about ?

-860004409	Following the war , some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic . One of the earliest such fields was Paris ‚Äì Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget , near Paris . The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919 , but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920 . In 1922 , the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then K√∂nigsberg , East Prussia . The airports of this era used a paved `` apron '' , which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft .			
-1994790442	The US Air Force Fitness Test ( AFFT ) is designed to test the abdominal circumference , muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF . As part of the Fit to Fight program , the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment ; the new fitness program was put into effect on 1 June 2010 . The annual ergo-cycle test which the USAF had used for several years had been replaced in 2004 . In the AFFT , Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components : waist circumference , the sit-up , the push-up , and a 1.5-mile ( 2.4 km ) run . Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100 , with the run counting as 60 % , waist circumference as 20 % , and both strength test counting as 10 % each . A passing score is 75 points . Effective 1 July 2010 , the AFFT is administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell ( FAC ) , and is required twice a year . Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score above a 90 % . Additionally , only meeting the minimum standards on each one of these tests will not get you a passing score of 75 % , and failing any one component will result in a failure for the entire test .	75 % is it much ?	75 % is it much ?	75 % is it much ?
-620635905	The Australian government controls the exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) and revenue from it extending 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) around Norfolk Island ( roughly 428,000km2 ) and territorial sea claims to three nautical miles ( 6 km ) from the island . There is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from Norfolk 's EEZ should be available to providing services such as health and infrastructure on the island , which the island has been responsible for , similar to how the Northern Territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources . The exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with fish , its only major natural resource . Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority ( AFMA ) to fish `` recreationally '' in a small section of the EEZ known locally as `` the Box '' . While there is speculation that the zone may include oil and gas deposits , this is not proven . There are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands , though about 25 per cent of the island is a permanent pasture . There is no irrigated land . The island uses the Australian dollar as its currency .	Hi just a sec . ending reading Hi –ö–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞ ? Zaebis How are you ? Toge zaebis . Slogno sidet tut What about you ?

2069686842	In an operational capacity , limitations in weapons technology and quick British reactions were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect . Attacking ports , shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas , especially the distribution of coal , an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War , would net a positive result . However , the use of delayed-action bombs , while initially very effective , gradually had less impact , partly because they failed to detonate . [ c ] Moreover , the British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack . Regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications and organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving .	hello

791686259	At the beginning of the Western Han dynasty , thirteen centrally controlled commanderies‚Äîincluding the capital region‚Äîexisted in the western third of the empire , while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten semi-autonomous kingdoms . To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu , Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings . By 157 BC , the Han court had replaced all of these kings with royal Liu family members , since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned . After several insurrections by Han kings‚Äîthe largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC‚Äîthe imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies . Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff ; this duty was assumed by the imperial court . Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes . The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han .	Who was emperor Gaozu ?

The Janpath ( Hindi : `` Path of the People '' ) , formerly Queen 's Way , begins at Connaught Circus and cuts the Rajpath at right angles . 19 foreign embassies are located on the nearby Shantipath ( Hindi : `` Path of Peace '' ) , making it the largest diplomatic enclave in India .

921498518	The variance in prevalence rates is reflected in people 's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time . Laumann et al. , ( 1994 ) found that among U.S. adults 20 % of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70 % responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions . Furthermore , sexuality is fluid such that one 's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life . Diamond ( 2003 ) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once , with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings . Furthermore , women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour . One woman stated `` I 'm mainly straight but I 'm one of those people who , if the right circumstance came along , would change my viewpoint '' . Therefore , individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be .

The Star-Ledger was the first mainstream newspaper to drop the term . Several local Jewish papers , including New York 's Jewish Week and Philadelphia 's Jewish Exponent have also dropped use of the term . According to Rabbi Shammai Engelmayer , spiritual leader of Temple Israel Community Center in Cliffside Park and former executive editor of Jewish Week , this leaves `` Orthodox '' as `` an umbrella term that designates a very widely disparate group of people very loosely tied together by some core beliefs .

257157133	Easter was the Sunday after the 15th day of this moon , whose 14th day was allowed to precede the equinox . Where the two systems produced different dates there was generally a compromise so that both churches were able to celebrate on the same day . By the 10th century all churches ( except some on the eastern border of the Byzantine Empire ) had adopted the Alexandrian Easter , which still placed the vernal equinox on 21 March , although Bede had already noted its drift in 725‚Äîit had drifted even further by the 16th century .	hi are you here ?	hi are you here ?	hi are you here ?
-1936356691	The Baltic was [ when ? ] a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War . Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre , which was close to Saint Petersburg , the Russian capital . In April 1854 an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of Kronstadt and the Russian fleet stationed there . In August 1854 the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt . The outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications . At the same time , the British and French commanders Sir Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes‚Äîalthough they led the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars‚Äîconsidered the Sveaborg fortress too well-defended to engage . Thus , shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in the summers of 1854 and 1855 , and initially , the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the Gulf of Finland . Naval attacks on other ports , such as the ones in the island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland , proved more successful . Additionally , allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the Finnish coast . These battles are known in Finland as the √Öland war .	Crimea is Ukraine ! Fuck you	Crimea is Ukraine !

-1425842683	There have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding . In a 2008 study , researchers analysed samples of Napoleon 's hair from throughout his life , as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries . All samples had high levels of arsenic , approximately 100 times higher than the current average . According to these researchers , Napoleon 's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy , and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning ; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives . [ note 7 ] Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning , and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death .	hi

-1645403440	Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria ; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses . A marsupial has a short gestation period , typically shorter than its estrous cycle , and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development ; in many species , this takes place within a pouch-like sac , the marsupium , located in the front of the mother 's abdomen . This is the plesyomorphic condition among viviparous mammals ; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy . Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way .

686773350	Henry III rebuilt the abbey in honour of a royal saint , Edward the Confessor , whose relics were placed in a shrine in the sanctuary . Henry III himself was interred nearby , as were many of the Plantagenet kings of England , their wives and other relatives . Until the death of George II of Great Britain in 1760 , most kings and queens were buried in the abbey , some notable exceptions being Henry VI , Edward IV , Henry VIII and Charles I who are buried in St George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle . Other exceptions include Richard III , now buried at Leicester Cathedral , and the de facto queen Lady Jane Grey , buried in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London . Most monarchs and royals who died after 1760 are buried either in St George 's Chapel or at Frogmore to the east of Windsor Castle . [ citation needed ]	hi

There are some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found . Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing .

On the other hand , he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change : alone , God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities , and requires the world to actualize them .

The chirigotas are well known witty , satiric popular groups who sing about politics , new times and household topics , wearing the same costume , which they prepare for the whole year . The Choirs ( coros ) are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes . Their signature piece is the `` Carnival Tango '' , alternating comical and serious repertory . The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in C√°diz , and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients . They have a more elaborated polyphony that is easily recognizable by the typical countertenor voice .	Were you at the carnival in Rio ? Or in Spain ?	Were you at the carnival in Rio ? Or in Spain ?

For a short time , when the University of Vienna closed , Hayek studied in Constantin von Monakow 's Institute of Brain Anatomy , where Hayek spent much of his time staining brain cells . Hayek 's time in Monakow 's lab , and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach , inspired Hayek 's first intellectual project , eventually published as The Sensory Order ( 1952 ) . It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels , rejecting the `` sense data '' associationism of the empiricists and logical positivists . Hayek presented his work to the private seminar he had created with Herbert Furth called the Geistkreis .	You know who Hayek is ?	You know who Hayek is ?	You know who Hayek is ?
-1041159794	Writing to a friend in May 1795 , Burke surveyed the causes of discontent : `` I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency , as they affect Ireland ; or of Indianism [ i.e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the British East Indies Company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect Asia ; or of Jacobinism , as they affect all Europe , and the state of human society itself . The last is the greatest evil '' . By March 1796 , however Burke had changed his mind : `` Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies , which are sapping its foundations , Indianism , and Jacobinism . In some Cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : But of this I am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other ; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal Government '' .			
1409725794	In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]	What 's the difference , what color is the skin , if the person is smart and can work well ?

-1456212066	Depending on a number of considerations , a company may apply for and be granted a patent for the drug , or the process of producing the drug , granting exclusivity rights typically for about 20 years . However , only after rigorous study and testing , which takes 10 to 15 years on average , will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug . Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug . When the patent protection for the drug expires , a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company . The development and approval of generics is less expensive , allowing them to be sold at a lower price . Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market . Restructuring has therefore become routine , driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry 's `` golden era '' in the 1990s and companies ' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues .

-2127753399	When granting assent by commission , the sovereign authorises three or more ( normally five ) lords who are Privy Counsellors to grant assent in his or her name . The Lords Commissioners , as the monarch 's representatives are known , wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack . The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud ; the senior commissioner then states , `` My Lords , in obedience to Her Majesty 's Commands , and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read , We do declare and notify to you , the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled , that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned .

1258844448	The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948 . Amazingly , there was only 1 injury at this game-Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter with St Edward 's Orphanage Band , playing the cornet . Goodison Park , like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented , is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000 , meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison . Everton 's record transfer paid was to Chelsea for Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku for a sum of ¬£28m . Everton bought the player after he played the previous year with the team on loan .

-947357300	To the north of China proper , the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu ( r. 209‚Äì174 BC ) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe . By the end of his reign , he controlled Manchuria , Mongolia , and the Tarim Basin , subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand . Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders , and he established a trade embargo against the group . Although the embargo was in place , the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs . Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets . In retaliation , the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province , where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC . After negotiations , the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance , but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes , food , and wine to the Xiongnu .

1374372544	Farming had been a traditional occupation for centuries , although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism . Grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps . In mid-June cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline , where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers . Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September . The Alpanschluss or D√©salpes ( `` coming down from the alps '' ) is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous cowbells while the farmers dress in traditional costumes .			
1061690308	Louis XIV distrusted the Parisians and moved his court to Versailles in 1682 , but his reign also saw an unprecedented flourishing of the arts and sciences in Paris . The Com√©die-Fran√ßaise , the Academy of Painting , and the French Academy of Sciences were founded and made their headquarters in the city . To show that the city was safe against attack , he had the city walls demolished , replacing them with Grands Boulevards . To leave monuments to his reign , he built the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations , Place Vend√¥me , Place des Victoires , and began Les Invalides .	I guess Louis was a good guy !

2107312123	The term `` high fidelity '' was coined in the 1920s by some manufacturers of radio receivers and phonographs to differentiate their better-sounding products claimed as providing `` perfect '' sound reproduction . The term began to be used by some audio engineers and consumers through the 1930s and 1940s . After 1949 a variety of improvements in recording and playback technologies , especially stereo recordings , which became widely available in 1958 , gave a boost to the `` hi-fi '' classification of products , leading to sales of individual components for the home such as amplifiers , loudspeakers , phonographs , and tape players . High Fidelity and Audio were two magazines that hi-fi consumers and engineers could read for reviews of playback equipment and recordings .	hi Maybe ae or xi will be interesting for you . who ?

-800454813	Prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency , new `` hybrid '' incandescent bulbs have been introduced by Philips . The `` Halogena Energy Saver '' incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W ; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents , by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light . This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W . More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency , up to a limit of about 270 lm/W ( 40 % of the maximum efficacy possible ) . Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm/W , approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs .	Who introduced hybrid incandescent bulbs ?

851057554	London was the world 's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . London 's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics , claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 , and 6,000 in 1866 . Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world 's first local urban rail network . The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties ; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War , the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city . Immediately after the war , the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war .	hi are you bot ?		
-259735634	The war had removed Bermuda 's primary trading partners , the American colonies , from the empire , and dealt a harsh blow to Bermuda 's merchant shipping trade . This also suffered due to the deforestation of Bermuda , as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion , for which it did not have raw materials . During the course of the following War of 1812 , the primary market for Bermuda 's salt disappeared as the Americans developed their own sources . Control of the Turks had passed to the Bahamas in 1819 .	\end		
-672210567	The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere , which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows . This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude , or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft . Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap , and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy .	Do you like telescopes ? I ca n't imagine that !

1575786644	In 1902 , Spalding , who by this time had revamped the roster to boast what would soon be one of the best teams of the early century , sold the club to Jim Hart . The franchise was nicknamed the Cubs by the Chicago Daily News in 1902 , although not officially becoming the Chicago Cubs until the 1907 season . During this period , which has become known as baseball 's dead-ball era , Cub infielders Joe Tinker , Johnny Evers , and Frank Chance were made famous as a double-play combination by Franklin P. Adams ' poem Baseball 's Sad Lexicon . The poem first appeared in the July 18 , 1910 edition of the New York Evening Mail . Mordecai `` Three-Finger '' Brown , Jack Taylor , Ed Reulbach , Jack Pfiester , and Orval Overall were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period . With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912 , the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span . Although they fell to the `` Hitless Wonders '' White Sox in the 1906 World Series , the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best winning percentage ( .763 ) in Major League history . With mostly the same roster , Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908 , becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice . However , the Cubs have not won a World Series since ; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports .	wow a huge text Who wrote the poem baseball 's sad lexicon ?

91759427	The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Samoa and Tonga . Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited ; thus the name , Tuvalu , means `` eight standing together '' in Tuvaluan ( compare to *walo meaning `` eight '' in Proto-Austronesian ) . Possible evidence of fire in the Caves of Nanumanga may indicate human occupation for thousands of years .	avilable	avilable	avilable
